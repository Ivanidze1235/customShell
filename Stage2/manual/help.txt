This is a manual page for customshell. To execute commands, simply type them and press ENTER.

List of commands:
clr - clears the screen
quit - exits the program
echo - outputs provided arguments
pause - halts execution of the program until ENTER is pressed
dir - lists the contents of the current directory, or another directory if path specified
environ - lists environment variables
help - outputs this information

Linux shell commands are also supported.

Background execution:
To execute an external command in background add an ampersand (&) at the end of your command (delimited by space or tab)
While a command is being executed in background, you can run other commands. Keep in mind that commands with extensive output often make using other commands impractical.

Input/Output redirection:
To redirect your input when using a command, use "< [filename]". This will set the input file of the command to the cosen file.
To redirect your output and rewrite the given file, use "> [filename]". This will result in the output of your command being stored in given file instead of the shell.
To redirect your output and append it to a file, use ">> [filename]". Instead of rewriting the file, it will append your output to existing file or create a new one if file does not exist.
